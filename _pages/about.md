Dr. Shahab Dehghan is a Lecturer in Power Systems at the Electrical Power Group in the School of Engineering at Newcastle University. Over the past decade, he has conducted research on modelling and analysing power and energy systems, intending to make future energy networks more sustainable, resilient, reliable, and cost-effective under static and dynamic techno-economic constraints. This includes the design of uncertainty-aware data-driven tools for investment and operation planning in multi-vector net-zero emission energy systems, transmission and distribution networks, and microgrids, with a specific focus on the integration of renewable resources, electric vehicles, storage systems, and power-to-gas/gas-to-power technologies as flexible sources. His research involves the development of several practical software packages, including an open-source Python-based Energy Planning ([PyEPLAN](https://pyeplan.sps-lab.org/)) model developed at the University of Leeds for creating sustainable microgrids in remote areas and a Whole-Electricity System Investment Model (WeSIM) developed at Imperial College London for creating net-zero emission whole energy systems.
